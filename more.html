<p>
On Dec 6, 1917, railway operator Vincent Coleman died in the Halifax explosion after warning the Rockingham station and many others to stop incoming trains.
</p>

<p>
The scene is beautifully reenacted in this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw-FbwmzPKo">heritage minute</a>,
and the Halifax explosion has been dramatized as the two part CBC series Shattered City, which can be
<a href="https://www.justwatch.com/us/movie/shattered-city-the-halifax-explosion">streamed online.</a>
</p>

<p>
All heritage minutes can be watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1848FF9428CA9A4A">here</a>.
</p>

<p>In the heritage minute, Vince's telegraph doesn't make the familiar beeps of today's Morse code, as he was using a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telegraph_sounder">sounder</a>, where a metal rod clicks in a metal frame at the start and end of each dot or dash.
He also wasn't using the International Morse Code used in the game, but rather the older and more complex <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Morse_code">Railway Morse.</a>
</p>

<p>
Vince's message at the end would have been sent out much more quickly than is shown in the game, as telegraph operators used
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_code_abbreviations">abbreviations</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosigns_for_Morse_code">prosigns</a> extensively.
</p>

<p>
The abbreviations and prosigns recevied from the Rockingham station include
<table style="border-collapse: collapse; border: none;">
    <tr>
      <td><b>AGN</b></td>
      <td>again</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><b>CFM</b></td>
      <td>confirm</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><b>DE CGRD</b></td>
      <td>from a hypothetical call sign for Rockingham station</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><b>GM</b></td>
      <td>good morning</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>

      <td><b>QRM</b></td>
      <td>are you experiencing interference?</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><b>QRS</b></td>
      <td>should I send more slowly?</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><b>QRU</b></td>
      <td>do you have anything for me?</td>
    </tr>

<h2>FAQ</h2>
<p style="white-space:pre">Q: How come I can only send T and E?
A: You're pausing too long between your dots and dashes. With the length of a dot as one "unit":
    a dash is be three units
    a pause between dots and dashes is be one unit
    a pause between characters is three units
    a pause between words is seven units
</p>

<p>
Q: Why do the letters keep changing?
<br>
A: The program figures out your keying speed dynamically. At the start of each message, it doesn't have much data about your keying speed,
so it will correct its transcription as you continue keying. It may help to not looking at the screen for the first few characters.
</p>

<p>
Q: How do I stop the train?
<br>
A: Try telling them there's a ship on fire, and to stop the train. It should recognize a variety of ways of expressing this.
</p>

<p>
Q: Wow, railway morse code is so cool! Can I read real Morse code railway transcripts?
<br>
A: Yep, though the only source I was able to find is in <a href="https://archive.org/details/w4fok_mill_morse_program">The Mill</a> by Jim Farrior.
It's easier to get through the transcripts by going through the individual files in the zip, rather than by going through the program.
</p>

<p>
Q: Are you going to make a game for each heritage minute?
<br>
A: Be the change you want to see in the world.
</p>

<p>
Q: Are you saying the medium is more important than the message it carries?
<br>
A: No, no, no. The medium is not more important than the message... it's obvious... the medium <i>is</i> the message.
</p>

<p>
    Q: This game was so fun, do you have other games?
    <br>
    A: Of course! Please visit <a href="https://perfumedhats.github.io/">the directory</a> for a complete listing
